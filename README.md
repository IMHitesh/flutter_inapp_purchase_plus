## üîç What this plugin do
This is an `In App Purchase` plugin for Flutter, forked from the original [flutter_inapp_purchase](https://github.com/hyochan/flutter_inapp_purchase) package.

We are actively maintaining and modernizing the codebase with support for the latest platform APIs:

 - ‚úÖ **Apple (iOS/macOS)**: We're adding support for **`StoreKit 2`**, Apple's modern in-app purchase framework. The original plugin deprecated Apple platform support, so this fork restores and extends compatibility using the latest StoreKit APIs.

- ‚úÖ **Android**: Integrated support for Google Play Billing Library version **`8.0.0`**, aligning with the latest Play Store requirements and security enhancements.

This plugin is intended to provide a future-proof, platform-compliant solution for handling in-app purchases across Flutter applications.

`PR` is always welcomed.

## üõí Purchase flow in `flutter_inapp_purchase_plus`

> When you've successfully received result from `purchaseUpdated` listener, you'll have to `verify` the purchase either by `acknowledgePurchaseAndroid`, `consumePurchaseAndroid`, `finishTransactionIOS` depending on the purchase types or platforms. You'll have to use `consumePurchaseAndroid` for `consumable` products and `android` and `acknowledgePurchaseAndroid` for `non-consumable` products either `subscription`. For `ios`, there is no differences in `verifying` purchases. You can just call `finishTransaction`. If you do not verify the purchase, it will be refunded within 3 days to users. Lastly, if you want to abstract three different methods into one, consider using `finishTransaction` method.

## üìä Data Types

- IAPItem

  ```dart
  final String productId;
  final String price;
  final String currency;
  final String localizedPrice;
  final String title;
  final String description;
  final String introductoryPrice;

  /// ios only
  final String subscriptionPeriodNumberIOS;
  final String subscriptionPeriodUnitIOS;
  final String introductoryPricePaymentModeIOS;
  final String introductoryPriceNumberOfPeriodsIOS;
  final String introductoryPriceSubscriptionPeriodIOS;

  /// android only
  final String subscriptionPeriodAndroid;
  final String introductoryPriceCyclesAndroid;
  final String introductoryPricePeriodAndroid;
  final String freeTrialPeriodAndroid;
  final String signatureAndroid;

  final String iconUrl;
  final String originalJson;
  final String originalPrice;
  ```

- PurchasedItem

  ```dart
  final String productId;
  final String transactionId;
  final DateTime transactionDate;
  final String transactionReceipt;
  final String purchaseToken;

  // Android only
  final String dataAndroid;
  final String signatureAndroid;
  final bool autoRenewingAndroid;
  final bool isAcknowledgedAndroid;
  final int purchaseStateAndroid;

  // iOS only
  final DateTime originalTransactionDateIOS;
  final String originalTransactionIdentifierIOS;
  ```

## ‚¨áÔ∏è Install

Add `flutter_inapp_purchase_plus` as a dependency in pubspec.yaml

For help on adding as a dependency, view the [documentation](https://flutter.io/using-packages/).

## üìù Usage Guide

#### Android `connect` and `endConnection`

- You should start the billing service in android to use its funtionalities. We recommend you to use `initConnection` getter method in `initState()`. Note that this step is necessary in `ios` also from `flutter_inapp_purchase_plus` which will also register the `purchaseUpdated` and `purchaseError` `Stream`.

  ```dart
    /// start connection for android
    @override
    void initState() {
      super.initState();
      asyncInitState(); // async is not allowed on initState() directly
    }

    void asyncInitState() async {
      await FlutterInappPurchase.instance.initConnection;
    }
  ```

- You should end the billing service in android when you are done with it. Otherwise it will be keep running in background. We recommend to use this feature in `dispose()`.

- Additionally, we've added `connectionUpdated` stream just in case if you'd like to monitor the connection.

  ```
  _conectionSubscription = FlutterInappPurchase.connectionUpdated.listen((connected) {
    print('connected: $connected');
  });
  ```

  > You can see how you can use this in detail in `example` project.

  ```dart
    /// start connection for android
    @override
    void dispose() async{
      super.dispose();
      await FlutterInappPurchase.instance.endConnection;
    }
  ```

#### Get IAP items

```dart
void getItems () async {
  List<IAPItem> items = await FlutterInappPurchase.instance.getProducts(_productLists);
  for (var item in items) {
    print('${item.toString()}');
    this._items.add(item);
  }
}
```

#### Purchase Item

```dart
void purchase() {
  FlutterInappPurchase.instance.requestPurchase(item.productId);
}
```

#### Register listeners to receive purchase

```dart
StreamSubscription _purchaseUpdatedSubscription = FlutterInappPurchase.purchaseUpdated.listen((productItem) {
  print('purchase-updated: $productItem');
});

StreamSubscription _purchaseErrorSubscription = FlutterInappPurchase.purchaseError.listen((purchaseError) {
  print('purchase-error: $purchaseError');
});
```

#### Remove listeners when ending connection

```dart
_purchaseUpdatedSubscription.cancel();
_purchaseUpdatedSubscription = null;
_purchaseErrorSubscription.cancel();
_purchaseErrorSubscription = null;
```

#### Receipt validation

We support receipt validation. For Android, you need separate json file from the service account to get the `access_token` from `google-apis`, therefore it is impossible to implement serverless. You should have your own backend and get `access_token`. With `access_token` you can simply call `validateReceiptAndroid` method we implemented. Further reading is [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/35127086/android-inapp-purchase-receipt-validation-google-play?utm_medium=organic&utm_source=google_rich_qa&utm_campaign=google_rich_qa).
Currently, serverless receipt validation is possible using `validateReceiptIos` method. The first parameter, you should pass `transactionReceipt` which returns after `requestPurchase`. The second parameter, you should pass whether this is `test` environment. If `true`, it will request to `sandbox` and `false` it will request to `production`.

```dart
validateReceipt() async {
  var receiptBody = {
    'receipt-data': purchased.transactionReceipt,
    'password': '******'
  };
  const result = await validateReceiptIos(receiptBody, false);
  console.log(result);
}
```

For further information, please refer to [guide](https://developer.apple.com/library/content/releasenotes/General/ValidateAppStoreReceipt/Chapters/ValidateRemotely.html).

#### App Store initiated purchases

When the user starts an in-app purchase in the App Store, the transaction continues in your app, the product will then be added to a list that you can access through the method `getAppStoreInitiatedProducts`. This means you can decide how and when to continue the transaction.
To continue the transaction simple use the standard purchase flow from this plugin.

```dart
void checkForAppStoreInitiatedProducts() async {
  List<IAPItem> appStoreProducts = await FlutterInappPurchase.instance.getAppStoreInitiatedProducts(); // Get list of products
  if (appStoreProducts.length > 0) {
    _requestPurchase(appStoreProducts.last); // Buy last product in the list
  }
}
```

### Sync with AppStore (Restore Purchase)

This method is used to synchronize the app with the App Store and restore any previously purchased non-consumable items or active subscriptions. It's particularly helpful in scenarios such as:

- After reinstalling the app

- When a user logs in on a new device

- To manually trigger purchase restoration

```dart
  void retsorePurchase() async {
    final result = await FlutterInappPurchase.instance.restorePurchases();
    if (result) {
      final purchases = await FlutterInappPurchase.instance.getAvailablePurchases();
      // This purchase is list of PurchasedItem
    }
  }
```

## üîê ProGuard

If you have enabled proguard you will need to add the following rules to your `proguard-rules.pro`

```
#In app Purchase
-keep class com.amazon.** {*;}
-keep class com.noble.** { *; }
-keep class com.android.vending.billing.**
-dontwarn com.amazon.**
-keepattributes *Annotation*
```
